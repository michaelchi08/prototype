# Allan Variance

The Allan variance (AVAR) also known as sigma-tau is a measure of
frequency stability in clocks, oscillators and amplifiers. The $M$-sample
variance is a measure of frequency stability using $M$ samples, time $T$
between measures and observation time $\tau$. $M$-sample variance is
expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{y}^{2} (M, T, \tau)
\end{equation}

AVAR is intended to estimate stability due to noise processes and not that of
systematic errors or imperfections such as frequency drift or temperature
effects.
