# Basis

A set of elements (vetors) in a vector space $V$ is called a **basis**, or
a set of **basis vectors**, if the vectors are linearly independent and
every vector in the vector space is linear combination of this set. In
more general terms, a basis is a linearly independent spanning set.

Given a basis of a vector space $V$, every element of $V$ can be expressed
uniquely as a linear combination of basis vectors, whose coefficients are
referred to as vector **coordinates** or **components**. A vector space
can have several distinct sets of basis vectors; however each such set has
the same number of elements, with this number being the dimension of the
vector space.
