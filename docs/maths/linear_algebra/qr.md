# QR Decomposition (factorization)

A QR decomposition (factorization) of a matrix is a decomposition of
a matrix $A$ into a product $A = QR$ of an orthogoanl matrix $Q$ and an
upper triangle matrix $R$. It is often used to solve linear least squares,
and is the basis for a particular eigen value algorithm, the QR algorithm.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}
\end{equation}
