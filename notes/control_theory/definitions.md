# Control Theory Definitions


- **Plants**: A plant may  be a piece of equipment, or system to be controlled.
- **Process**: A natural progressively continuing operation or development
  marked by a series of graduate changes that succeed one another in
  a relatively fixed way.
- **Systems**: A system is a combination of compontets that act together and
  perform a certain objective.
- **Disturbances**: A disturbance is a single that tends to adversely affect
  the value of the output of a system. If a disturbance is generated within the
  system, it is called internal, while an external disturbance is generated
  outside the system and is an input.
- **Feedback Control**: Refers to an operation that in the presence of
  disturbances tends to reduce the difference between the output of a system
  and some reference input and does so on the basis of this difference.
