# Motion Modeling Definitions

- **State** of a system is a vector of system variables that
  entirely defines the system at a specific instance in time.
- **State vector is complete** if it is the **best predictor** of the
  future.
- **Inputs** of a system are the set of variables that drive the system
  that can be controlled.
- **Disturbances** of a system are the set of variables that drive the system
  that cannot be controlled.
