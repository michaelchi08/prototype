# Group

A mathematical group $G$ is a structure consisting of a finite or infinite set
of elements plus some binary operation (the group operation), which for any
two group elements $A, B \in G$ is denoted as the multiplication $AB$.

A group is said to be a group _under_ some given operation if it fulfills
the following conditions:

1. **Closure**: The group operation is a function $G \times G \mapsto G$,
   that is, for any $A, B \in G$ we have $AB \in G$.
2. **Associativity**: For $A, B, C \in G, (AB)C = A(BC)$.
3. **Identity element**: There must exists an identity element $I \in G$
   such that $IA = AI = A$ for any $A \in G$.
4. **Inverse**: For any $A \in G$ there must exist an inverse element
   $A^{-1}$ such as $AA^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I$.
