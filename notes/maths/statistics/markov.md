# Markov Property

Markov property refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process.
A stochastic process has the Markov property if the conditional probability
distribution of future states of the process (conditional on both the past and
present states) depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of
events that preceded it.

- **Markov process** is a process that satisfies the Markov property
- **Markov assumption** is used to describe a model where the markov property
  is assumed to hold, such as a **hidden Markov model**.
- **Markov random field** extends the Markov property to two or more dimensions
  or to random variables defined for an interconnected network of items.
- **Markov chain**: is a discrete-time stochastic process that satisfies the
  Markov property.
